PROS:
 I feel a little more comfortable with Bootstsrap and forming a responsive web app. My button is able to display information in the console when clicked.

 CONS: 
  Difficulty with grasping JS concepts at this time. I was able to write a function and have it executed via the console, but was not able to have a full userinput experience.
